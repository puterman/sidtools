   Sidtools is a set of utilities for creating playlists for SidPlay,
and also to make SidPlay play them.  It contains four programs:
makelist, which creates a database file out of the sids on your system,
search2list, which lets you search this database file and output
playlists, sidlist, which lets you play these and other playlists and
sidplayo, which is a wrapper for SidPlay.

   This manual documents version 1.0 of sidtools.

What is sidtools
****************

   sidtools is a bunch of small tools to be used with Sidplay on Linux
systems.  It should work under other Unix systems as well. If it
doesn't, please write an email and tell me about your problems.
`sidtools' lets you create a database of your sids, which can be
searched for keywords to create playlists.  You can also create
playlists manually or use a directory as a playlist.  Read the rest of
this document to find out more about the details.

What is Sidplay?
================

   `sidplay' is a program that lets your Linux/Unix system play sids,
i.e. music files that have been extracted from C-64 programs.  The
Linux/Unix version is command line based, which gives you all the
advantages of running a Unix system, e.g. you can pipe data to it and
from it, which `sidtools' utilize.  If you want to know more about
`Sidplay', have a look at
<http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/>, the Sidplay home
page.  You can also use other sidplayers, like `VICE' (very
experimental) and LittleSID, but I haven't tested that much.

What is the HVSC?
=================

   `HVSC', the High Voltage SID Collection, is a huge collection of
sids.  Version 3.7 contains more than 12000 sid files, many of which
contain more than one subtune.  If you're interested in listening to
C-64 music, you should have a look at <http://www.hvsc.c64.org/>.

Why use sidtools?
=================

   If you, like me, dislike graphical user interfaces, you probably
don't want to use any of the GUI frontends for `Sidplay'.  `sidlist'
lets you create playlists, so that you don't have to issue a command
each time you want to change the sid you're listening too.  This can be
very convenient if you want to listen to sids while working on something
else.  All you have to do is create a playlist (which `search2list' can
do automatically for you, if you don't want to create your own
playlists manually) and launch `sidlist'.  While writing this, I'm
listening to an automatically created playlist with all the songs from
HVSC that have the copyright year 1983.  Nice, huh?  `sidlist' can also
play random tunes.

Installing sidtools
*******************

Getting sidtools
================

   You can find the latest version of `sidtools' at
<http://user.tninet.se/~uxm165t/sidtools.html>

Installing sidtools
===================

   Move the downloaded archive (`sidtools-VERSION.tar.gz') to where you
usually put your source code archives (e.g. `/usr/local/src/') and
unpack it with:

     tar -xzvf sidtools-VERSION.tar.gz

This creates the directory `sidtools-VERSION'.  Move into that
directory and configure it for your system.

   Just follow these simple steps and everything should work out nicely:
   * Type `./configure'.  This will configure `sidtools' for your
     system.

   * Now type `make'.  This will compile and link the C programs.

   * To install the programs and the documentation, type `make install'.

   * If you don't like `sidtools', type `make uninstall' to uninstall
     it, and send me an email and tell me why you don't like it.  My
     email address is <uxm165t@tninet.se>.

Using sidtools
**************

makelist
========

   `makelist' is a program you'll only need to use once (until you
upgrade your sid collection), so we might as well do that at once.  What
it does is that it goes through your sid collection and creates a
database by extracting some information from the sids themselves (name
of the author, title of song and copyright) and add the path to the
song.  On my system the sids live in the directory
`/usr/local/games/C64Music', so I'd type

     makelist /usr/local/games/C64Music -o DB_NAME

DB_NAME is the name of the database file.  `makelist' will tell you
which directories it's working on, and it'll probably take a few
minutes for it to finish.  If you just type

     makelist PATH_TO_SIDS PATH_TO_MORE_SIDS

the database will by default be written to the file specified in the
configuration file.  If there is no configuration file, it will instead
be written to a file in your home directory called `.sidtoolsdb'.  And
as the example shows, you can also specify more than one directory
where you keep your sids.  This can be handy if you don't have all your
sids under one directory.  Of course, you could then tell makelist to
search from the root directory, but that would probably take lots of
extra time, so this is a much better solution if you, like me, have the
HVSC installed somewhere under /usr and then have some other sids in
your home directory.

   `makelist' will also write a file in your home directory called
`.sidtoolsrc', which is the configuration file for sidtools.  This file
has the following fields:

   * `SIDDB': This is the path to the sid database which `makelist'
     creates.

   * `HVSC_BASE': The root directory of the High Voltage Sid Collection
     (or, if you don't have it, the root directory to your SID
     collection, whatever it might be).

   * `SIDPLAY': The name of the binary that you use to play SIDs, e.g.
     `sidplay'.

   * `SIDPLAY_ARGS': The arguments you want to pass to the sidplayer by
     default.

   So in the example above, `PATH_TO_SIDS' should be the root directory
of your HVSC installation.

   The option `-n' (or `--no-rc') makes `makelist' not write the rc
file (~/.sidtoolsrc).  This can be useful if you want to keep more than
one database.

   A good idea, if you get new sids on a regular basis (e.g. if you rip
them yourselves), is to let a cron job run `makelist' every day.

   So, now that you have a database, you might as well start using it!

search2list
===========

   `search2list' uses the database you've just created to create
playlists for you.  What you do is that you provide it with search
strings, that will be searched for in the author, title, copyright,
number of songs, default start song, load address, init address, play
address and/or file size fields. In the author, title and copyright
fields you can use regular expressions as keywords, for more flexible
searches.

   When given the `--extra-information' or `-e' argument `search2list'
gives you all the information from the sid header, like title, author,
copyright, init and play addresses etc. You can also use the
`--stil-information' or `-z' option to get STIL info about the tune.
This output can't be used as a playlist.

   Here's an example to get you started:

     search2list --author=hubbard --title=commando

This search specifies that the string `hubbard' should be in the author
field and that the string `commando' should be in the title field.
This just gives me one hit, Rob Hubbard's Commando tune (of course).
The path of the sids found will be printed to the screen, which isn't a
problem.  If you want to capture those in a file (which can be used as
a playlist), just type something like

     search2list --copyright=1982 > 1982-sids

This will search the copyright fields for the string `1982', which will
of course return all the sids that were copyrighted in 1982, _and_ it
will put the paths to these sids in the file `1982-sids', which can now
be used as a playlist.  If you want to tell `search2list' which
database file to use explicitly, you can do that too on the command
line:

     search2list --database=my_database -a hubbard -c 1985 > hubbard-85-sids

This will search the database `my_database' for all the sids that
`hubbard' composed and that were copyrighted in 1985, and put them in
the file `hubbard-85-sids'.  This example also illustrates the short
Unix-style versions of the option, where `-a' does the same thing as
`--author' and `-c' does the same thing as `--copyright'.

     search2list --author=hubbard --start-tune=2 >hubbard-start-2

This is just an example of the more unusual search options.  The
`--start-tune=2' argument searches for sid files where the default
start song is number 2.  The other more exotic options are:

   * -number-of-tunes=NUMBER searches for the specified number of songs

   * -number-of-tunes=">NUMBER" searches for sids with at least this
     number of subtunes

   * -number-of-tunes="<NUMBER" searches for sids with at most this
     number of subtunes

   * -load-address=HEX_NUMBER searches for the specified load address

   * -load-address="<HEX_NUMBER" searches for the sids with at least the
     specified load address

   * -load-address=">HEX_NUMBER" searches for sids with at most the
     specified load address

   * -init-address=HEX_NUMBER searches for the specified init address

   * -init-address="<HEX_NUMBER" searches for sids with at least the
     specified init address

   * -init-address=">HEX_NUMBER" searches for sids with at most the
     specified init address

   * -play-address=HEX_NUMBER searches for the specified play address

   * -play-address="<HEX_NUMBER" searches for sids with at least the
     specified play address

   * -play-address=">HEX_NUMBER" searches for sids with at most the
     specified play address

   * -file-size=NUMBER searches for the specified file size

   * -file-size=">NUMBER" searches for sids with this minimum file size

   * -file-size="<NUMBER" searches for sids with this maximum file size

`search2list' doesn't output its playlists sorted in alphabetical order
(but rather in the internal order of the file system).  If you want the
output to be sorted, just pipe the list through the command sort, like
this:
     search2list -a "jeroen tel|orcan" --file-size="<5000" | sort

This will find all sids, composed by Jeroen Tel or Orcan that are at
most 5000 bytes long and display them in alphabetical order.  Of course
only the path names will be sorted, so they will primarily be sorted by
directory, and secondarily by file name.  If you absolutely want to have
the songs sorted by title, you should have a look at commands like cut,
awk, sed etc.

   Here's another example of using regular expressions:

     search2list --author="hubbard|jeroen tel" --copyright="1984|1988"

This will give you the songs composed by Rob Hubbard or Jeroen Tel,
copyrighted in 1984 or 1986.  The type of regular expressions are the
ones that are provided by the GNU C library.  I won't try to teach you
about regular expressions here, so you'll have to try to find that info
elsewhere, if you want to use them, but don't know anything about them.
I'm no regexp wizard myself, but feel free to ask me if there's anything
you want to know.  NB: all matchings are case insensitive, so you don't
have to do stuff like `search2list -a "[Gg]alway"'.

   Okay, time to use these playlists for something!

sidlist
=======

   At last we'll be able to use the playlists.  The easy way to use
`sidlist' is to place yourself in the directory where you keep your
playlists (like `1982-sids' and `hubbard-85-sids' from the above
examples) and type something like

     sidlist hubbard-85-sids

This will start playing the sids in the `hubbard-85-sids'-list,
printing out the usual `sidplay' info about the songs on the screen as
it progresses through the list.  By default `sidlist' keeps playing
each song for 3 minutes.  You can of course change this, by specifying
how long you want each sid to be played (in seconds):

     sidlist 1982-sids --time=120

This will play all the songs in the `1982-sids'-list, playing 2 minutes
(120 seconds) of each sid.

   You can always skip to the next sid in the playlist by pressing
`ENTER'.

   Of course you can also connect `search2list' and `sidlist' with a
pipe, so that you don't have to create playlists as files.  Just type
something like

     search2list -a hörnell | sidlist - --time=300

The `-' argument to `sidlist' tells it to take its input from stdin,
which in this case is the output from `search2list'.  Each tune will be
played for five minutes.  (_WARNING!_ Don't try that exact command
line, because it'll play the songs composed by Karl Hörnell, and, well,
they might cause severe mental damage... I take no responsibility if
you try the above command line and go deaf or insane!)

   To play random tunes, you can type

     sidlist --random

This will make sidlist pick random tunes from the database you created
with `makelist' and play them.

   If you don't want to start from the beginning of the list you can
specify which song to start from with the `--start-tune' switch.
Example:

     sidlist greatest_hits_list --start-tune=10

Here's another example:

     search2list -a "jeroen tel" | sidlist - --time=120 --start-tune=10

This will play all songs by Jeroen Tel, except for the first 10, for
two minutes each.

   If you want to stop `sidlist', just press `C-c'.

   With the `--delay' argument you can make sidlist take a pause
between tunes.  This can be handy if sidplay isn't killed quickly
enough, so that you get error messages about sidplay not being able to
open the audio device.  You can specify how many seconds you want it to
pause.  The default is 0.

     sidlist --random --delay=2

This will play random tunes with 2 seconds of silence between tunes.  I
added the `--delay' option because I had problems when using the OSS
sounddrivers (the ones shipped with the Linux kernel), but since I
switched to ALSA (<http://www.alsaproject.org>) I don't need this
anymore.

   With the `--database' (or `-b') option you can specify which
database file you want to use with sidlist (for playing random tunes).
Here's an exampel:

     sidlist --random --database=my_database

   This will not use the default database specified in `.sidtoolsrc',
but instead use the file `my_database'.

   If you want to pass a certain set of arguments to the sidplayer
(which is usually Michael Schwendt's SidPlay), use `--args'.  Here's an
example of a situation where this can be useful:

     search2list -a taki | sidlist --args=-ns -

   Here `search2list' will find all the tunes by Taki and they will be
piped to `sidlist', which will play them by using an external
sidplayer.  The arguments `-ns' will be given to that sidplayer with
every song that is played from the playlist.  If that external
sidplayer is SidPlay, the `-ns' argument means that it should simulate
the use of the newer 8580 SID chip, instead of the default 6581 one.
So what the above example does is that it plays the tunes by Taki with
8580 emulation (which sounds better than the default 6581 emulation).

   All the options, `--random, --delay, --time-to-wait, --database,
--args' and `--start-tune' can also be written in the old Unix way, as
`-r, -d, -t, -b, -a' and `-s'.  Here's an example:

     sidlist -r -d 2 -s 3 -t 100

You can also use a directory as a playlist.  If I want to listen to all
the songs by Rob Hubbard, I'd type something like

     sidlist /usr/local/games/C64Music/Hubbard_Rob

Command line arguments to the sidplayer can also be used in playlists.
Open the playlist with a text editor and add a '@' after an entry, and
then type in the command line arguments for that song after the '@'.
An example: let's say you have a list that consists of these two lines:

     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Hubbard_Rob/Action_Biker.sid.gz
     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Yip/Uuno_Turhapuro.sid.gz

If you wanted to listen to the second track of Uuno_Turhapuro, instead
of the first one, which is the default, you'd have to add the argument
'-o2' (if you're using Sidplay), like this:

     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Hubbard_Rob/Action_Biker.sid.gz
     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Yip/Uuno_Turhapuro.sid.gz@-o2

Simple, isn't it?  You can of course give several arguments on the same
line in this way, for example:

     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Hubbard_Rob/Action_Biker.sid.gz
     /usr/X11/games/C64Music/Yip/Uuno_Turhapuro.sid.gz@-o2 -f44100 -16 -s

sidplayo
========

   `sidplayo' can be used just like `sidplay'.  It'll return you to the
prompt, though, so that you can do other things at the same console.
To change sid, you just typ `sidplayo' followed by the name of the sid
you wish to listen to.  If you just want to stop it, just type
`sidplayo'.


File: sidtools.info,  Node: Command Reference,  Next: Database Format,  Prev: Using sidtools,  Up: Top

Command reference
*****************

   Here's a quick guide to the usage of `sidtools':

     makelist <dirs> [-n|--no-rc] [ -o <db_file> ]

Creates a database file by analyzing the sids in `dirs' (as many as you
want) and subdirectories.  If you don't specify a database file, it
will be saved as `.sidtoolsdb' in your home directory.  The first
argument will also be written to your `.sidtoolsrc' as the root of your
HVSC (High Voltage Sid Collection), and will be used by `search2list',
if you tell it to give you STIL information.  `-n' or `--no-rc' means
that the rc file (`~/.sidtoolsrc') won't be created/written.

     sidplayo [args] [sid_file]

Plays the 'sid_file', and passes the arguments (args) to Sidplay.  Just
typing `sidplayo' at the shell prompt stops playing the current sid (or
does nothing, if no sid is playing).

     sidlist [option] <list | dir | - >

Plays the tunes in the playlist `list' or in the directory `dir' or, if
`-' is given as argument, the playlist that it gets from standard
input.  The options are:
   * -h or -help: Shows usage information.

   * -r or -random: Plays random tunes

   * -s or -start-tune=NUMBER: Starts playing tune NUMBER from the
     playlist.

   * -t or -time-to-wait=SECONDS: Plays each tune for SECONDS seconds.

   * -d or -delay=SECONDS: Waits SECONDS seconds between tunes.

   * -a or -args=ARGUMENTS: Passes ARGUMENTS to the sidplayer.

   * -b or -database=DATABASE_FILE: specifies that you want to use
     DATABASE_FILE instead of the default database file.

   You can always skip to the next tune in the playlist by pressing
`ENTER'.

     search2list [-d<db_file>] <options>

Searches the database created by makelist.  You must use at least one
of the following search options:
   * -author=REGEXP

   * -title=REGEXP

   * -copyright=REGEXP

   * -number-of-tunes=NUMBER

   * -number-of-tunes=">NUMBER"

   * -number-of-tunes="<NUMBER"

   * -start-tune=NUMBER

   * -start-tune="<NUMBER"

   * -start-tune=">NUMBER

   * -load-address=HEX_NUMBER

   * -load-address="<HEX_NUMBER"

   * -load-address=">HEX_NUMBER"

   * -init-address=HEX_NUMBER

   * -init-address="<HEX_NUMBER"

   * -init-address=">HEX_NUMBER"

   * -play-address=HEX_NUMBER

   * -play-address="<HEX_NUMBER"

   * -play-address=">HEX_NUMBER"

   * -file-size=NUMBER

   * -file-size=">NUMBER"

   * -file-size="<NUMBER"

The argument `--extra-information' (or `-e') doesn't give you a
playlist, but all the info about the tunes that match the search
criteria.  The argument `--stil-information' (or `-z') also displays
STIL info about the tunes.

   Note: You have to quote the arguments to `file-size',
`number-of-tunes', `play-address', `init-address', `load-address' and
`start-tune' if you want to use `<' or `>'.  Otherwise, the shell will
think you're trying to redirect stdin or stdout.  Example:
     search2list --file-size=">7000"


File: sidtools.info,  Node: Database Format,  Prev: Command Reference,  Up: Top

Database Format
***************

   The database that is created by `makelist' is just a plain text
file.  The format might change in future versions to be identical to
that used in Tomten's Sid Search by Per Bolmstedt (<tomten@C64.org>),
but I'm quite content with it, after the changes made for version
0.4.5.  Per's database contains both the information from the sid
headers and from the STIL text file.  The `sidtools' database has the
same information, but the STIL info is in another format.

   An entry for one tune consists of two lines: one for the info from
the sid header and one for the STIL info.  If there isn't a STIL entry
for a tune, the STIL line in the database is empty.

   The sid header lines consists of ten fields, separated by @
characters.  All the info is taken directly from the headers of the
sids themselves.  The fields are:
   * Song title.

   * Composer.

   * Copyright information.  The copyright year and the copyright
     holder.

   * Path to the tune.  This will of course vary from system to system,
     depending on where the sid collection is in the file system.

   * Number of songs in the sid file.

   * Default song.  This is the number of the song that will be played
     unless you explicitly tell `sidplay' to play some other song with
     the `-o' option.

   * Load address (hexadecimal).  This is the address where the data
     should be loaded in the C-64's memory.

   * Init address (hexadecimal).  This is the address where the
     initialization routine is.

   * Play address (hexadecimal).

   * File size of the sid (in bytes).

   The line also ends with a @ character.

   The STIL lines consist of just one field: the whole STIL entry.  The
newline characters (0x0a) have been replaced by '}', so that the whole
entry can fit on one line.  The carriage return characters (0x0d) have
been replaced by space characters.  When the STIL field is parsed by
`search2list', the '}' characters are replaced by newlines, so
`search2list' prints out the STIL entries exactly as they are written
in STIL.txt.  This is sick and should be changed. :-)

   The first line of the database file contains the total number of
sids in the database, which is used for the random routine in `sidlist'.
