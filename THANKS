sidtools THANKS file
====================

Per Bolmstedt <tomten@C64.org> wrote the original Perl CGI version of
sid search, on which search2list is based (not the code, but the
concept).  He's also helped with suggestions for various things.

Simon Kågedal <sika8225@csd.uu.se> for suggesting I include getopt.c,
instead of using my own ugly argument parsing for systems without
glibc. 

LaLa <LaLa@C64.org> has reported problems with running sidtools under
Solaris.

Yuuki NINOMIYA <gm@smn.enjoy.ne.jp> for writing parsecfg and choosing
the GNU GPL as license for it.  That saved me some work.

Goetz Waschk for reporting a bug.

All the great composers who made all the music that these tools are
supposed to be helpful in playing.
