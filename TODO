Things to do after 1.0:
-----------------------

- Clean up the code in various ways.  Make it modular and independent
  of user interface.
- Make the search options for search2list more flexible?  Right now
  you can't do a search for Hubbard as composer _or_ Hubbard as
  title.  But that isn't really a problem, is it?
- Keep working on the GTK+ frontend.  It sort of works right now, but
  it's ugly and a lot of features are missing.  If you'd like to help
  out, drop me a line.  It'll probably have to be rewritten from
  scratch anyway, along with the rest of sidtools.
- Add some signal handling to sidlist.  It responds in a very
  unintuitive way to e.g. C-c and C-z right now.  Might have to
  rewrite all the primitive system() stuff.
- Fix up the kludgey src/Makefile.am and configure.in stuff.
- Make it portable to all Unices out there (should be mostly configure
  work).
- Add more features?  Any suggestions?
- Support for controlling sidlist over the network.
